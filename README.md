## CMS

You can write articled directly into this Rails site with the basic built article writing tools or import them from the Bricolage CMS via SOAP.

When writing directly, <p> and <br /> tags are added automatically (thanks simple_format), and it also lets you use basic <html> tags too.

To upload images, simply drag the images into the article page. Images auto-format at the top of the page, but if you'd like to manually position them in the page use the tag format [File:xx] where xx is the image :id number of the image you just uploaded.
