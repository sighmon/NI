## Features

* Subscribe for 3 or 12 months.
* Buy a single issue.
* Read it in HTML, or a specific app.

### MJML email templates

We use the https://mjml.io email markup framework to generate HTML email code via this [MJML-Rails gem](https://github.com/sighmon/mjml-rails).

Install it locally to get it to render the .mjml template files:

```$ npm install -g mjml```

* Note: you might have to specify a version number to align with the gem i.e. ```$ npm install -g mjml@2.1.1```

## CMS

You can write articled directly into this Rails site with the basic built article writing tools or import them from:

* Bricolage CMS via SOAP
* Drupal CMS

When writing directly, <p> and <br /> tags are added automatically (thanks simple_format), and it also lets you use basic <html> tags too.

To upload images, simply drag the images into the article page. Images auto-format at the top of the page, but if you'd like to manually position them in the page use the tag format [File:xx] where xx is the image :id number of the image you just uploaded.
