Dear supporter,

For 50 years, readers of New Internationalist – from decolonization campaigners to teenage climate strikers – have been inspired to take action by our campaigning journalism. Now we need to grow its audience, in order to equip a new generation of readers with the tools for change found in every issue of the magazine.

So we’re launching a new Solidarity Fund, which will get magazine subscriptions to schools, campaign groups and young activists. If you have ideas about who might benefit the most from receiving one, please let us know.

We’d like to ask for your support in launching this project. If you choose to make a regular donation to New Internationalist, you will be contributing to the Solidarity Fund as well as our award-winning independent journalism.

If you’ve ever been inspired or educated by something you’ve read in New Internationalist, imagine the impact a subscription could have on a class discussion about climate change or austerity, or on a young campaigner looking for guidance on how to shape the world. Your regular donation will make this a reality.

In solidarity,

Conrad Landin
Co-editor, New Internationalist
Old Music Hall, 106-108 Cowley Rd, Oxford  OX4 1JE UK
