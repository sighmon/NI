New Internationalist Subscription - Automatic-renewal cancelled
===============================================================

<%= @greeting %> <%= @user.username %>,
Your automatic-renewal has now been cancelled via PayPal.

In the meantime your subscription will continue until your subscription payment runs out, so you can still read magazines at:
<%= issues_url(:protocol => "https") %>

<% if @user.expiry_date %>
Your subscription expiry date is:
<%= @user.expiry_date.strftime("%e %B, %Y") %>
<% end %>

Cheers, the NI team.

PS Was there something wrong with our site or magazine? Could we improve our service? We'd love to hear the reasons why you cancelled
